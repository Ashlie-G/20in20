# Requirements for committing
There are no requirements. I will look at every contribution and we will discuss it as equals. I will seriously consider every proposed change.
If the request is an education exercise, such as learning to commit to an open source repository, I promise to do my best to accomodate.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on social media, the Discord server, or via email at dehartdean@gmail.com

Thank you, and happy coding,

Dean DeHart
